# custom-matplotlib
I'm not really a fan of the standard Matplotlib style and, recently, I've been using a customized version of it. Here it is.

It's not perfect, but it's not bad either. Let me know if there's anything that looks terrible, or if you think something is aethetically unpleasant.

If you use this for something serious, let me know as well!
